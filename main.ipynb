    "## Data Collection: \n",
    "For this project, I obtained a dataset from NASA that provides detailed information about the NEOs and their approximate distance from Earth. The data is extracted via the NASA API for the month of January 2023. Due to the API's 7 days data fetch limit, the data is collected in 4 separate chunks, each corresponding to 7-day period in the month of January 2023. These chunks are then, merged to form a complete dataset for the entire month of January.\n",
